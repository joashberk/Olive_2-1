"Styling with Tailwind": [
  "Use Tailwind for all layout and styling work.",
  "Avoid overriding Tailwind defaults unless necessary.",
  "Ensure mobile-first responsiveness by default.",
  "Use consistent spacing and font sizing tokens from Tailwind's scale.",
  "Avoid using `@apply` or writing custom CSS unless Tailwind can't solve the need.",
  "Default page padding: Use `px-4` for mobile and `px-8` for desktop views. Apply this to main content containers and navigation elements.",
  "Maintain consistent vertical spacing with `py-4` for mobile and `py-8` for desktop views.",
  "Use `max-w-2xl mx-auto` for content width constraints to ensure optimal readability."
